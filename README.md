This experiment is a near replication of Experiment 1 by Gao and Theeuwes. It uses a Working Memory task and Visual Search Task to study if top-down and selection history factors show an additive or interactive effect on attentional selection. This experiment was created as part of my assignment for PSY710 for PhD Program at Ahmedabad University
